# organ-donation
This is my non-profit project. 
In Vietname, there are many people die everyday because hopitals don't have enough organ to transplant for them.
While a lot of people also die because of disease or traffic accident and their orgran can be used to transplanted for people above. But it
is extremely difficult to persuade their family donate.

This website provides useful informations about organ donation. 
More than that, it helps to raise people's cognition about this activity.
I also made social network to support for website and gained some positive results.

But this area is quite sensitive, so Goverment forced me to stop doing this. 
I personally think that I did nothing wrong. I will continue develop it in the future,
but I need to prepare more carefully.
